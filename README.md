# AI Mathematical Olympiad Prize Competition

This repository contains all the resources and code developed for the [AI Mathematical Olympiad Prize](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-prize) competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of this competition is to develop AI models that can solve mathematical problems typically posed at the high school level and beyond.

## Competition Description

The AI Mathematical Olympiad Prize challenges participants to create models that can understand, interpret, and solve mathematical problems. The competition involves creating algorithms that can take a mathematical problem as input and provide the solution as output.

### Objectives
- **Developing a Model:** To build a model capable of solving diverse mathematical problems.
- **Interpretability:** To ensure that the model's methodology in arriving at solutions is interpretable.
- **Accuracy:** To achieve high accuracy in solving the problems correctly.
